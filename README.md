# LootTracker

LootTracker is a React-based web app designed to both setup and curate a game wishlist and budget. 
It also has a browser extension component for Chrome that allows adding games to you wishlist
directly from the Steam Store. [LootTrackerExtension](https://github.com/SaskuatchofAZ/LootTrackerExtension)

## Usage:

* Navigate to the [deployed site](https://loot-trackerz.herokuapp.com/), sign up and go to the wishlist page. 
* Enter a budget to begin, then start looking for games! 
* In the search results box hit the ADD button to add it to your wishlist. If you decide you want to remove a game hit the REMOVE button on the right side of the entry in the wishlist. 
* Should you purchase the game hit the PURCHASE button (this will disable the REMOVE button). Your total budget and game purchases will be tracked, and visual breakdowns of budget remaining and spending over time will be available on the Stats page. 
* To use the [extension](https://github.com/SaskuatchofAZ/LootTrackerExtension), please log in and keep the page open before opening the Steam store in a new tab. With the extension active a new button will be available on any game page in the game feature box on the right-hand side
* Clicking the ADD TO LOOTTRACKER button will link you back to the app and a pop-up will let you know the game has been successfully added before navigating you back to the WIshlist page.
